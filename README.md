# LTJelloSwitch

A cute UISwitch prototype built in about 8 hours. One of my co-worker gave me this concept last year. It was written in Objective-C and now translated into Swift.

__DO NOT USE IT__, it's not production ready because I used a lot of magic numbers generated with [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com). All assets of PaintCode are in the `Design` folder.
